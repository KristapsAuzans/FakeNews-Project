                    <p>RIA Novosti (Russian: РИА Новости), sometimes RIA (Russian: РИА) for short, was Russia's international
                        news agency until 2013 and continues to be the name of a state-operated domestic Russian-language
                        news agency. Operating under the purview of the Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media,
                        RIA Novosti is headquartered in Moscow and operated about 80 bureaus internationally. On 9 December
                        2013 President of Russia Vladimir Putin ordered RIA Novosti's liquidation and the creation of a Russian
                        international news agency Rossiya Segodnya. Dmitry Kiselev, an anchorman of the Russia-1 channel
                        was appointed to be the first president of the new information agency. RIA Novosti was scheduled
                        to be closed down in 2014; starting in March 2014, staff were informed that they had the option of
                        transferring their contracts to Rossiya Segodnya or accepting voluntary redundancy. On 10 November
                        2014, Rossiya Segodnya launched the Sputnik multimedia platform as the international replacement
                        of RIA Novosti and Voice of Russia. Within Russia itself, however, Rossiya Segodnya continues to
                        operate its Russian language news service under the name RIA Novosti with its ria.ru website. The
                        agency published news and analysis of social-political, economic, scientific and financial subjects
                        on the Internet and via e-mail in the main European languages, as well as in Persian, Japanese and
                        Arabic. It had a correspondent network in the Russian Federation, CIS and over 40 non-CIS countries.
                        Its clients include the presidential administration, Russian government, Federation Council, State
                        Duma, leading ministries and government departments, administrations of Russian regions, representatives
                        of Russian and foreign business communities, diplomatic missions, and public organizations. RIA Novosti
                        was an award-winning news agency. The last editor-in-chief of RIA Novosti was Svetlana Mironyuk,
                        the first woman appointed to the role in the agency's history. According to the organisation's Charter,
                        enterprise's property was federally owned (because federal unitary enterprise) and was indivisible.
                        According to the agency, it was partially government-subsidized (2.7–2.9 billion roubles in 2013),
                        but maintained full editorial independence.</p>

                    <p>Lenta.ru (Russian: Лента.Ру; stylised as LƐNTA·RU) is a Moscow-based online newspaper in Russian language,
                        owned by Rambler Media Group which belongs to Prof-Media. It is one of the most popular Russian language
                        online resources with over 600 thousand visitors daily. A Berkman Center 2010 study found it to be
                        the most cited news source in the Russian blogosphere. In 2013 companies "SUP Media" and "Rambler-Afisha"
                        united in the Combined company "Afisha.Rambler.SUP". On March 12, 2014 the owner, Alexander Mamut,
                        fired the Editor-in-Chief Galina Timchenko and replaced her with Alexey Goreslavsky. 39 employees
                        out of the total 84, including Director-general Yuliya Minder, lost their jobs. This includes 32
                        writing journalists, all photo-editors (5 people) and 6 administrators. The employees of Lenta.ru
                        issued a statement that the purpose of the move was to install a new Editor-in-Chief directly controlled
                        by the Kremlin and turn the website into a propaganda tool. Dunja Mijatović, the OSCE Representative
                        on Freedom of the Media, referred to the move as a manifestation of censorship. Galina Timchenko,
                        together with a team of around 20 journalists who resigned from their jobs at Lenta.ru, started the
                        new internet newspaper Meduza.</p>

                    <p>Vesti has a right-wing editorial stance, like Israeli Russian-language media in general.In 1999 it was
                        described as "rightist-to-center on the peace process, and close to Likud on internal issues". It
                        supported Natan Sharansky in Israel's 1996 elections.The Israeli academic Tamar Horowitz states that
                        the paper, and the Russian press in general, played an important role in those elections: "It was
                        Vesti that defined Netanyahu's success in the 1996 elections. The voice of the Labor Party was absent
                        from the pages of the Russian newspapers. Had there been a Labor equivalent to Vesti, the results
                        would have been very different." In 1997 Vesti's readers chose Avigdor Lieberman as "Politician of
                        the Year".The paper strongly opposed disengagement from Gaza in 2005. Each day the paper includes
                        a supplement on a different topic: health, home life, sports, etc. Vesti was edited by one of its
                        founders, the right-wing Soviet refusenik Eduard Kuznetsov, until he was fired in December 1999.
                        Many people attributed a political motive to Kuznetsov's firing, although Vesti denied this. At the
                        time The Jerusalem Post reported anonymous claims that Kuznetsov had been fired for his criticism
                        of Sharansky's Yisrael BaAliyah party, or even at the party's request, while Religious Zionist news
                        outlet Arutz Sheva stated that an advisor to Ehud Barak "was reportedly instrumental in bringing
                        about Kuznetsov's dismisal [sic]". The Zionist Forum and the right-wing group Professors for a Strong
                        Israel protested the firing.Kuznetsov was succeeded by Vera Yedidia, also the presenter of a program
                        on Israeli public television. Vesti managing editor Yulia Shamalov-Berkovich, another of the paper's
                        founders, later became a Kadima politician, joining the Knesset in 2009.</p>
